# Oblig2_Software
First i created a repository in intelliJ by choosing to share the project on Github. 
Then in Github i created a workflow by clicking on actions in Git and creating new workflow. 
You then have to add the code on what programming language you are running it on, and giving the information the artificial system is gonna run in.
The workflow also contains the condition it is going to run in, in this case every time i push. [push]
I also had to run  "update-index --chmod=+x gradlew" in the IntelliJ terminal.
The last thing I did was to add the code , "testLogging", so that the tests i have in the code also runs with the workflow.
